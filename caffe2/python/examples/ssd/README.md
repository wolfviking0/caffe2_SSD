# SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Object Detector

SSD is an unified framework for object detection with a single network.

### Disclaimer
This is a re-implementation of original SSD which is based on caffe. The official
repository is available [here](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd).
The arXiv paper is available [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325).

This example is intended for SSD detection in caffe2. Converting the caffe trained model to caffe2. 
However, due to different implementation details, the results might differ slightly.
